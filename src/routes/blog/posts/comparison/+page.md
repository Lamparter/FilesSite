As the built-in File Explorer has seen some changes in recent version of Windows, it's interesting to consider what makes Files different from Windows File Explorer.

Recent updates to File Explorer in Windows 11 have brought significant improvements, including a refreshed design and the long-awaited addition of tabs. Meanwhile, Files has consistently provided a modern interface and tabbed navigation for users on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.

However, what truly sets Files apart goes beyond tabs. While this feature has gained popularity, it was never meant to be the sole defining feature. Our aim was to create a modern file manager with an intuitive UX in collaboration with the community—an ambitious goal. Although there are still many exciting features we haven’t yet explored, Files stands out from File Explorer and other file managers through a range of unique differences, not just its tabs and modern styling.

So, here are a few key differences that make Files what it is:

- Available on Windows 10: Files is backwards compatible down to Windows 10, whereas Explorer's newer functionality is only available on Windows 11.
- A consistent dark theme: Files uses the latest technologies and a powerful theming engine that makes it heavily customisable.
- Customisable keyboard shortcuts: Files has a built-in UI in the settings pane to allow you to customise the keyboard shortcut for every action in the interface, making it truly accessible.
- SmartExtractionFeature

- Option to display folder sizes: Files calculates and displays folder sizes to make browsing easy.
- ADS integration: There are options to view and create alternate data streams on supported drives, making use of the native functionality.
- Dual pane: You can split your view in two to make organising your files and folders easier.
- Synchronised layout: Files provides an easy option to synchronise your layout options across all directories for maximum consistency.
- Sorting options: Files has advanced file sort options that let you sort files and folders together.
