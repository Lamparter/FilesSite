As the built-in File Explorer gets more features and newer File Explorer alternatives release, it's interesting to consider what makes Files different from the Windows File Explorer.

In the recent years, File Explorer has had some major changes, including tabs, more consistent WinUI styles, and the experimental Pizza rewrite of File Explorer in the Windows App SDK.

When tabs were introduced to File Explorer in 2022, many members of the Files Community questioned the future of Files. As the lead developer of Files put it:

> The simple answer is that tabs was never the main point of Files, in fact, it wasn't even a feature for the first couple releases.

And it's true - there are many differences that make Files an entirely different app than File Explorer, not just tabs and WinUI styles; what makes Files unique is the focus on usable design and features that make it easier to get work done.

So, here are a few key differences that make Files what it is:
- Available on Windows 10: Files is backwards compatible down to Windows 10, whereas Explorer's newer functionality is only available on Windows 11.
- A consistent dark theme: Files uses the latest technologies and a powerful theming engine that makes it heavily customisable.
- Customisable keyboard shortcuts: Files has a built-in UI in the settings pane to allow you to customise the keyboard shortcut for every action in the interface, making it truly accessible.
