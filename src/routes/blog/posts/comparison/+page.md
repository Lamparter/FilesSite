As the built-in File Explorer has seen some changes in recent version of Windows, it's interesting to consider what makes Files different from Windows File Explorer.

Recent updates to File Explorer in Windows 11 have brought significant improvements, including a refreshed design and the long-awaited addition of tabs. Meanwhile, Files has consistently provided a modern interface and tabbed navigation for users on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.

However, what truly sets Files apart goes beyond tabs. While this feature has gained popularity, it was never meant to be the sole defining feature. Our aim was to create a modern file manager with an intuitive UX in collaboration with the community. Although there are still many exciting features we haven’t yet explored, Files stands out from File Explorer and other file managers through a range of unique differences, not just its tabs and modern styling.

Files distinguishes itself in numerous ways, and as it continues to improve, we’re committed to maintaining backward compatibility with Windows 10. This ensures that all the great features and benefits of Files are accessible to more users, not just those running the latest version of Windows 11.
Another area where Files stand out is in its design and user experience. Built from the ground up with the latest UI frameworks from Microsoft, it looks and feels like a natural extension of Windows. This attention to detail extends beyond the main interface, Files maintains a consistent look and feel across the app, including a proper dark mode. Additionally, it supports custom themes and background images, allowing users to personalize their experience.
